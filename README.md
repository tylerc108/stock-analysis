# Stock Analysis
## Overview of Project
 
 During this project, we conducted analysis on data collected on various stocks and their performance in the years 2017 and 2018. The data we received included several points of data for each stock for each date in the respective year, e.g. the opening and closing price of the stock and the volume of the stock on the respective date.
